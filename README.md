Project based on the competition hosted by kaggle to mine research
papers so that they can be searched with ease by people trying
to keep up with research related to the corona virus.

1. The tf_idf_similarity file does an analysis on the titles of papers provided in the biorxiv folder.
   It essentially takes in a query and returns the articles most relevant to that query.
2. Create a Doc2vec model which basically convert a document into a vector. CBOW word2vec model for one sentence is ready. Have to extend it to all the research papers in biorxiv folder
